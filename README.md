# My Porfolio
### Created using React
<br>
<br>

## Description
This is an application with links to several of my projects as a developer. The original portfolio was created using HTML and CSS, but I created this one with React by refactoring my existing files and importing them into React. I deployed the application using both Github Pages and Heroku (just in case).
