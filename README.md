# My Porfolio
### Created using React

## Description
This is an application with links to several of my projects as a developer. The original portfolio was created using HTML and CSS, but I created this one with React by refactoring my existing files and importing them into React.

## Installation
Once downloaded be sure to use 'npm i' in your commande console to download the dependencies. From there simply enter 'npm start' and a react page should generate.
